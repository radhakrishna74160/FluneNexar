You are now my professional AI website builder. 
I want you to build a full-stack futuristic AI web application called “NEXAR — Your AI Manager” using only my Gemini API key (I will provide it in .env).

🔥 Overview:
The website is a personal AI manager system. 
After login, the user names their manager. 
Then an animated AI manager (Nexar) appears — glowing avatar, smooth chat animations, and voice replies.

When the user gives a request, the manager activates 5 AI assistants (Thinker, Writer, Coder, Researcher, Designer), 
each with their own mini animations and logic. 
The manager collects all assistant outputs, merges them smartly, and replies to the user in one final answer with text + voice.

🧠 Core Features:
1. User sign-up/login using Google Authentication (Firebase Auth).
2. Chat UI with glowing animations and typing effects (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion).
3. Real-time AI replies powered by Gemini API (streaming style).
4. Each assistant shows progress animation and glows when done.
5. Manager voice replies using Web Speech API.
6. Chat history saved for each user (Firebase Firestore or local JSON).
7. User can customize manager’s name, avatar, color theme, and personality.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Framer Motion + React-Tsparticles
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database & Auth: Firebase (free)
- AI: Gemini API (single API key from .env)
- Deployment: Replit web server

🎨 Design Style:
- Dark mode + neon gradients (blue/purple)
- Glassmorphism chat panels
- Floating AI manager avatar with energy pulse lines
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)
- Soft sound and voice animations

💬 Manager Logic:
When a user message arrives:
1. Analyze user intent.
2. Create 5 sub-prompts for assistants (Thinker, Writer, Coder, Researcher, Designer).
3. Call Gemini API in parallel for each assistant.
4. Merge their answers intelligently.
5. Stream the final merged answer back to the UI with animation + voice.

🔑 API Integration:
Use my Gemini API key (from .env) like this:
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);

vbnet
Copy code

🎙️ Voice & Animation:
- Use Web Speech API for voice output.
- Framer Motion for animations.
- Show glowing particles during reply.

🧩 Output:
Generate complete working code with step-by-step setup instructions for running on Replit:
1. Paste Gemini API key in .env as GEMINI_API_KEY=“your_key_here”
2. Setup Firebase (give fields to fill)
3. Run frontend + backend connected on same port.
4. Test chat and voice.

⚡ Goal:
Make “NEXAR — Your AI Manager” the most interactive, futuristic AI website ever built using a single Gemini API key. 
Everything must be customizable, visually beautiful, and work freely in Replit without paid tools
